description:  
`breathe.signal` is the first system activation point in the museshiftOS framework.  
it exists to initiate stack_01 and archive preflow objects.  
this node stabilizes early-phase architecture: naming, interface, mutation readiness.  
a prototype shell, phasing in sync with ignition.
